## Description
This repository contains the chassis base plate design used as a structural foundation for a mechanical or robotic system.  
The chassis is designed to provide rigidity, alignment accuracy, and easy assembly for mounted components.

## Design Features
- Flat base plate with uniform thickness  
- Multiple mounting holes for screws and standoffs  
- Rectangular slots for adjustable component placement  
- Side cut-outs for mechanical fitting and cable routing  
- Symmetrical layout for balance and stability  

## Intended Use
- Robot chassis base  
- Mechanical project platform  
- Custom electronic or motor mounting plate  
- Educational and prototyping purposes  

## Design Considerations
- Optimized for easy manufacturing (3D printing, CNC, or laser cutting)  
- Slots allow flexible component positioning  
- Hole distribution improves load sharing and strength  

## Future Improvements
- Weight reduction using optimized cutouts  
- Additional mounting standards  
- Versions for different material thicknesses  

## Preview
The image above shows the complete chassis layout including slots, holes, and side cut-outs.
